### Scenario

The pcap for this monthâ€™s Wireshark quiz is from an AD environment, 
and it contains real-world traffic from a simulated enterprise setting. 
Details of the local area network (LAN) from the pcap follow.

- LAN segment range: 10.0.0[.]0/24 (10.0.0[.]0 through 10.0.0[.]255)
- Domain: work4us[.]org
- Domain Controller IP address: 10.0.0[.]6

### Workflow & write up

1. Check what's in export objects
2. If not a lot of objects, check object hashes on virus total
3. See packet and see the whole stream of conversation
4. Find machine info and who is infected

1. Export objects from wireshark, hash it and check on virus total
![ObjectDownload](images/download.jpg)
export from wireshark
![hash](images/hashing.jpg)
hash in sha256
![VT](images/vt.jpg)
VT saying that it's a trojan.qbot

2. Find the infected machine info
![overview](images/overview.jpg)
The wireshark info will show the IP, and Mac addr for the download
![followStream](images/convo.jpg)
Follow stream and go to the http request header and you will find the time of first request
![host](images/hostname.jpg)
Search the ip addr/mac addr to and dhcp to find the host name
![findU](images/finduser.jpg)
Use the filter `kerberos contains "DESKTOP-E7FHJS4"` to find all kerberos packets related to this host, apply cname as a colume
and see what user logged into the host
